AssembleX V2.0

AssembleX a free open-source software helping the simulation and execution process of an assembly code on
a RISC-V processor. Fisrt Version used to work the help of Venus simulator which was a VS code extension.
AssembleX Version 2.0 has an integrated assembler inside which eliminates the interference of Venus Simulator.
User manual is included in the README.md included in the repository. AssembleX is design in order to run and
execute assembly codes on phoeniX RISC-V process of IUST-ERC; but can also be used on other projects as an
instruction memory generator.
